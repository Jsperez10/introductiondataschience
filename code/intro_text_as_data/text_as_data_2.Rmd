# Manupulating text in R

### Adapted from code by Ken Benoit

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE
)
```
In this section we will work through some basic string manipulation functions in R.

## String handling in base R

There are several useful string manipulation functions in the R base library. In addition, we will look at the `stringr` package which provides an additional interface for simple text manipulation.

The fundamental type (or `mode`) in which R stores text is the character vector. The most simple case is a character vector of length one. The `nchar` function returns the number of characters in a character vector. 

```{r message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
s1 <- 'my example text'
length(s1)
nchar(s1)
```

The `nchar` function is vectorized, meaning that when called on a vector it returns a value for each element of the vector.
```{r }
s2 <- c('This is', 'my example text.', 'So imaginative.')
length(s2)
nchar(s2)
sum(nchar(s2))
```

We can use this to answer some simple questions about the inaugural addresses.

Which were the longest and shortest speeches?
```{r}
inaugTexts <- texts(data_corpus_inaugural)
which.max(nchar(inaugTexts))
which.min(nchar(inaugTexts))
```

Unlike in some other programming languages, it is not possible to index into a "string" -- where a string is defined as a sequence of text characters -- in R:

```{r}
s1 <- 'This file contains many fascinating example sentences.'
s1[6:9]
```

To extract a substring, instead we use the `substr` function. 

```{r}
s1 <- 'This file contains many fascinating example sentences.'
substr(s1, 6,9)
```

Often we would like to split character vectors to extract a term of interest. This is possible using the `strsplit` function. Consider the names of the inaugural texts:

```{r}
names(inaugTexts)
# returns a list of parts
s1 <- 'split this string'
strsplit(s1, 'this')
parts <- strsplit(names(inaugTexts), '-')
years <- sapply(parts, function(x) x[1])
pres <-  sapply(parts, function(x) x[2])
```

The `paste` function is used to join character vectors together. The way in which the elements are combined depends on the values of the `sep` and `collapse` arguments:

```{r} 
paste('one', 'two', 'three')
paste('one', 'two', 'three', sep = '_')
paste(years, pres, sep = '-')
paste(years, pres, collapse = '-')
```


`tolower` and `toupper` change the case of character vectors.
```{r}
tolower(s1)
toupper(s1)
```

Character vectors can be compared using the `==`  and `%in%` operators:
```{r}
tolower(s1) == toupper(s1)
'apples'=='oranges'
tolower(s1) == tolower(s1)
'pears' == 'pears'

c1 <- c('apples', 'oranges', 'pears')
'pears' %in% c1
c2 <- c('bananas', 'pears')
c2 %in% c1
```




## Pattern matching and regular expressions

Matching texts based on generalized patterns is one of the most common, and the most useful, operations in text processing.  The most powerful variant of these is known as a _regular expression_.

A regular  expression (or "regex"" for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You may have probably already used a simple form of regular expression, called a ["glob"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)), that uses wildcards for pattern matching.  For instance, `*.txt` in a command prompt or Terminal window will find all files ending in `.txt`.  Regular expressions are like glob wildcards on steroids.  The regex equivalent is `^.*\.txt$`.  R even has a function to convert from glob expressions to regular expressions:  `glob2rx()`.  

In **quanteda**, all functions that take pattern matches allow [three types of matching](http://quanteda.io/reference/valuetype.html): fixed matching, where the match is exact and no wildcard characters are used; "glob" matching, which is simple but often sufficient for a user's needs; and regular expressions, which unleash the full power of highly sophisticated (but also complicated) pattern matches.

### Regular expressions in base R

The base R functions for searching and replacing within text are similar to familiar commands from the other text manipulation environments, `grep` and `gsub`. The `grep` manual page provides an overview of these functions.

The `grep` command tests whether a pattern occurs within a string:

```{r}
grep('orangef', 'these are oranges')
grep('pear', 'these are oranges')
grep('orange', c('apples', 'oranges', 'pears'))
grep('pears', c('apples', 'oranges', 'pears'))
```

The `gsub` command substitutes one pattern for another within a string:
```{r}
gsub('oranges', 'apples', 'these are oranges')
```

### Regular expressions in **stringi** and **stringr**

The [**stringi** package](http://www.gagolewski.com/software/stringi/) is a large suite of character ("string") handling functions that are superior in almost every way to the equivalent base R functions.  One reason that they are better lies in how they handle Unicode text, which includes character categories and covers all known languages.  **stringi** boasts of being "THE R package for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient string/text processing in every locale and any native character encoding".  In this case, however, it's no idle boast.  If you are serious about low-level text processing in R, you will want to spend time learning **stringi**.  The **quanteda** package relies heavily on its functions.

A somewhat simpler-to-use package than **stringi** is the **stringr** package.  It wraps many of **stringi**'s low level functions in more convenient wrappers, although with fewer options.  
For an overview of the most frequently used functions, see the vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html.

#### Matching

Using some **stringr** functions, we can see more about how regular expression pattern matching works.  In a regular expression, `.` means "any character".  So using regular expressions with **stringr**, we have:
```{r}
require(stringr)

pattern <- "a.b"
strings <- c("abb", "a.b")
str_detect(strings, pattern)
```

Some variations

```{r}
# Regular expression variations
str_extract_all("The Cat in the Hat", "[a-z]+")
str_extract_all("The Cat in the Hat", regex("[a-z]+", TRUE))

str_extract_all("a\nb\nc", "^.")
str_extract_all("a\nb\nc", regex("^.", multiline = TRUE))

str_extract_all("a\nb\nc", "a.")
str_extract_all("a\nb\nc", regex("a.", dotall = TRUE))

```

#### Replacing

Besides extracting strings, we can also replace them:
```{r}
fruits <- c("one apple", "two pears", "three bananas")
str_replace(fruits, "[aeiou]", "-")
str_replace_all(fruits, "[aeiou]", "-")

str_replace(fruits, "([aeiou])", "")
str_replace(fruits, "([aeiou])", "\\1\\1")
str_replace(fruits, "[aeiou]", c("1", "2", "3"))
str_replace(fruits, c("a", "e", "i"), "-")
```

#### Detecting

Functions also exist for word detection:
```{r}
fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pinapple")
str_detect(fruit, "e")
fruit[str_detect(fruit, "e")]
str_detect(fruit, "^a")
str_detect(fruit, "a$")
str_detect(fruit, "b")
str_detect(fruit, "[aeiou]")

# Also vectorised over pattern
str_detect("aecfg", letters)
```

We can override the default regular expression matching using wrapper functions.  See the difference in behaviour:
```{r}
str_detect(strings, fixed(pattern))
str_detect(strings, coll(pattern))
```

#### Segmentation

We can also segment words by their boundary definitions, which is part of the Unicode definition.  **quanteda** relies heavily on this for _tokenization_, which is the segmentation of texts into sub-units (normally, terms).
```{r}
# Word boundaries
words <- c("These are   some words.")
str_count(words, boundary("word"))
str_split(words, " ")[[1]]
str_split(words, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```

#### Other operations

**stringr** can also be used to remove leading and trailing whitespace.  "Whitespace" has an [extensive definition](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Zs/list.htm), but can be thought of in its most basic form as spaces (`" "`), tab characters ("\t"), and newline characters ("\n").  `str_trim()` will remove these:
```{r}
str_trim("  String with trailing and leading white space\t")
str_trim("\n\nString with trailing and leading white space\n\n")
```
